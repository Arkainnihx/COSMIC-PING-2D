Stretch Goals:
  Code Refactoring
  Pause menu
  Sound
    Orbs make (procedural) sound based on mass and velocity
    Orb colliding with paddle (and edge) sound
    Orb collision combination sound?
  A selection of different playing fields, with static obstacles
  Powerups/Modifiers? If powerups benefit one player, do we need orb "ownership"? Defined by current orb colour. Orb colour changes to same colour as player when it bounces off their paddle.
